I've been inspired by posts on the [homelab subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) where people have posted pictures of their DIY network walls and wanted to do my own. A common theme is using a board of plywood or a pegboard as the base board on which the network gear is fastened.

A few examples here:

{% include gallery id="gallery-networkwalls" caption="Network walls posted on reddit (click for higher res)" layout="half" %}

So, this post will mark the start of my own network wall project.

I got these wall mount brackets from a local hardware shop and will attach my networking devices on there with some 3d printed adapters I will design.

I've gotten started with onshape for my CAD journey and made this very good looking part that slots in nicely in the holes in the wall mount. I got it 3d-printed courtesy of the fine fellows at [Makerspace Ã–stersund](https://www.facebook.com/OSDmakerspace).

That's it for now, stay tuned!
